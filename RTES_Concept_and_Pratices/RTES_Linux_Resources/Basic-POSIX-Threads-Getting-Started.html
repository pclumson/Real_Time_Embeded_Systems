<h3>POSIX Threading for Real-Time Embedded Linux</h3>
POSIX Threads, or "Pthreads", are used extensively in this course.  They can be learned by example and by studying the manual pages, but tutorials on POSIX threading are available from a number of sources, and will be quite helpful if you are new to this topic.
<p>
POSIX is a set of standards for portable operating systems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)">Wikipedia POSIX Overvew</a>).  POSIX threads have mostly been used for concurrency and parallel programming for applications, however, they can be used for Real-Time applications and systems by making use of the POSIX Real-Time extensions and careful use of them on embedded Linux systems.
