Set up your Home Lab (Raspberry Pi recommended, Jetson avanced, VB-Linux for non-RT development)

1) Raspberry Pi Canakit quick start - https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi
2) NVIDIA Jetson Nano quick start - https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit
3) Virtual Box for VM-Linux - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
4) Ubuntu Linux LTS - https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

Most Linux embedded system developers use "vi" and "gdb" since they are most often built-in and available on
every Linux system.  However, if you are new to Linux, you may want to access some tutorial information and/or use
some alternative tools that are more visual in nature.

Here are some helpful GDB resources

1) Cheat Sheet - https://in-addr.nl/mirror/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf

2) GDB Tutorial - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/gnu_debugger/gnu_debugger_tutorial.pdf

3) Other graphical debugger and development tools of interest

	a) Nemiver visual debugger - sudo apt install nemiver
	b) DDD visual debugger - sudo apt install ddd
	c) VS-Code for Linux - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Here are some helpful "vi" resources

1) Cheat Sheet (many out there - use google and vi cheat sheet) - http://web.mit.edu/merolish/Public/vi-ref.pdf
2) vim Cheat Sheet - https://vimsheet.com/

If you don't like command line debuggers and "vi", you may want to use VS-Code, or use a visual debugger along with simpler editors compared to vi such as:

1) "nano" or "pico" - normally built into Linux distributions
2) geany - simple visual editor
3) vim - sudo apt install vim - an improved version of the built-in vi editor
